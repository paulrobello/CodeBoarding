"""Pkl warm-start updater: bring a cached per-language analysis up to date in-memory.

Given a cached analysis dict (loaded from the SHA-tagged pkl) and the file
list git reports as changed since the pkl's tag SHA, rerun the LSP for those
files only and merge the result with the kept-from-cache state. No JSON, no
disk writes — the only persistence is the pkl save that ``StaticAnalyzer``
performs after this returns.

    Steps:

    1. ``invalidate_files`` drops every node/edge/reference/class/package
       entry sourced from a changed file, leaving the cached state of every
       *unchanged* file intact.
    2. The LSP re-analyses just the changed files (existing ones; deleted
       files contribute nothing).
    3. ``merge_results`` unions the kept-from-cache state with the fresh
       per-file result.
    4. Surviving entries are filtered against the live filesystem so a
       deleted file's references / classes / package members are removed
       from the merged dict.

    Returns a fresh dict with the same shape as ``cached_analysis``. The
    caller stuffs it into ``StaticAnalysisResults`` and saves the pkl
    tagged with the *current* source SHA.

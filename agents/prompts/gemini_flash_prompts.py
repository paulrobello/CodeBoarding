Prompt templates for Google Gemini Flash models.

Gemini Flash Prompt Design Principles:
    - Prompts are kept short and direct. Gemini Flash is optimized for speed and performs best with
      concise instructions rather than elaborate context; excessive verbosity increases latency
      without improving output quality.
    - Minimal formatting overhead: no XML tags, no heavy markdown structure, no checklists. Gemini Flash
      handles plain, direct instructions effectively and doesn't need structural cues to follow them.
    - Tool usage guidance is brief ("Use tools when necessary") rather than prescriptive. Gemini Flash
      is reasonably proactive with tool use and doesn't need exhaustive tool-by-tool instructions.
    - These prompts serve as the default/fallback template for unrecognized model types, so they are
      designed to be model-agnostic enough to work reasonably well across providers.

INCREMENTAL_GROUPING_MESSAGE = """Update the architecture of `{project_name}` by routing changed and new CFG clusters to the right components.

Project Context:
{meta_context}

Project Type: {project_type}

The previous analysis established the components below. Most clusters are unchanged and stay where they are; this prompt only shows the slice that changed (new clusters or clusters whose member methods changed).

### Existing components
{existing_components}

### Cluster groups to assign
{cfg_clusters}

Your Task:
For each cluster shown above, decide which component it belongs to. Work through the clusters and for each one choose one of two paths:

1. **Route to an existing component.** Reference the component by its exact **component_id** from the list above (e.g. `1.3`). Carry over the component's **name** and a short **description** unchanged, and list the cluster ids that should land here. Multiple groups of clusters can point to the same existing component — that is fine and expected.

   For each routed cluster, also indicate whether a **redetail** pass is needed. Default to yes. Only say no when the change is cosmetic — a refactor, internal rename, small bug fix, or formatting change that leaves the component's high-level purpose untouched. When redetail is not needed, the existing description is preserved as-is and no follow-up pass runs. If you are unsure, lean toward yes.

2. **Create a new component.** Give it a fresh **name** that does not duplicate any existing component, write a **description** explaining what this component does and why these clusters belong together, and choose a **parent_id** — the existing component whose scope most naturally encloses the new one, or leave it null for a root-level component.

Important rules:
- Identity is tracked by **component_id**, not by name. Reusing an existing component's name without pointing to its component_id will create a duplicate — that is wrong. If clusters belong in an existing component, you must reference its **component_id**.
- Every cluster id listed in the "Cluster groups to assign" section must appear in exactly one entry's **cluster_ids**."""

Prompt templates for DeepSeek models.

DeepSeek Prompt Design Principles:
    - Uses markdown headers (# Task, # Instructions, # Required outputs) for clear hierarchical
      structure. DeepSeek models are trained heavily on code and technical documentation, so they
      parse and follow markdown-structured prompts more reliably than prose-style instructions.
    - Instructions are labeled with explicit ordering ("execute in order") because DeepSeek can
      otherwise reorder or skip steps when given unordered lists.
    - Prompts are concise and technically direct, avoiding role-playing preambles. DeepSeek performs
      best with matter-of-fact instructions focused on what to do, not who it is.
    - Avoids XML tags and heavy formatting. DeepSeek doesn't benefit from these structural cues the
      way Claude does; plain markdown hierarchy is sufficient and produces cleaner outputs.

Route each changed or new CFG cluster into the correct component — either an existing one or a brand new one.

# Existing components
Each line shows the component id and its name:
{existing_components}

# Cluster groups to assign
{cfg_clusters}

# Instructions

1. For each cluster group listed above, decide whether it belongs in an existing component or requires a new one.

2. If routing to an existing component, reference it by its exact component id from the list above (e.g. `"1.3"`). Reuse that component's current name. Include the cluster ids that now belong there. Multiple groups of clusters can route to the same component if they are functionally related.

3. Decide whether the component's description needs updating. Default to yes. Only skip the update when the change is cosmetic — a refactor, internal rename, small bug fix, or formatting change that does not alter the component's high-level purpose. When in doubt, request the update.

4. If creating a new component, give it a fresh name distinct from every existing component, write a description explaining what this component does and why these clusters belong together, and specify a parent component id to attach it under (or leave it at root level). Choose the parent whose scope most naturally encloses the new component.

# Critical rule
Identity is by component id, not by name. Reusing an existing component's name without explicitly referencing its component id will fork a duplicate — that is wrong. When clusters belong in an existing component, always reference that component by its id.

Every cluster id listed in the "Cluster groups to assign" section must appear in exactly one output entry."""

"""
Prompt templates for Moonshot Kimi models.

Kimi Prompt Design Principles:
    - Every prompt begins with "You are Kimi, an AI assistant created by Moonshot AI." This identity
      anchor is required because Kimi performs significantly better when its own identity is reinforced
      at the start of each message, not just in the system prompt.
    - Emphasizes explicit chain-of-thought cues ("Reason step-by-step", "Think aloud first",
      "Decompose tasks into parallel subtasks"). Kimi benefits from being told to reason before
      acting; without these cues it tends to jump to conclusions or produce shallow analysis.
    - Includes "Use tools proactively to verify facts" directives because Kimi's default behavior
      is conservative with tool usage; it needs encouragement to call tools rather than guess.
    - Prompt structure is conversational but directive, matching Kimi's training style. Overly formal
      or rigid formatting (like strict markdown headers) is less effective than natural task framing.

Components in this scope:

Cross-component communication from static analysis:

Reason step-by-step. Review the components listed above and the cross-component communication evidence, then produce relationships that describe how these components interact.

Think aloud first about which components actually communicate based on the evidence, then for each relationship provide:
- **src_name**: Source component name
- **dst_name**: Target component name
- **relation**: A short phrase describing the relationship (e.g. "delegates to", "notifies", "provides data to")

Constraints:
- Every src_name and dst_name must match an existing component name exactly
- Maximum 2 relationships per component pair, avoiding bidirectional sends/returns pairs (i.e. ComponentA sends to ComponentB and ComponentB returns to ComponentA)
- Focus on architecturally significant interactions, not implementation details
- Use the cross-component communication evidence to ground relationships in actual code flow
- A component that never calls or is called by another component should not have a relation to it

1. Analyze the clusters shown above and identify which ones work together or are functionally related.
2. Group related clusters into meaningful components.
3. A component can contain one or more cluster IDs (e.g., [1], [2, 5], or [3, 7, 9]).
4. For each grouped component, provide:
   - **name**: Short, descriptive name for this group (e.g., 'Authentication', 'Data Pipeline', 'Request Handling')
   - **cluster_ids**: List of cluster IDs that belong together (as a list, e.g., [1, 3, 5])

INCREMENTAL_GROUPING_MESSAGE = """You are Kimi, an AI assistant created by Moonshot AI.

Reason step-by-step about how the architecture of `{project_name}` should change as new and modified CFG clusters arrive. Use tools proactively to verify any cluster placement you're not confident about.

Project context:
- Project: {project_name}
- Type: {project_type}
- Meta: {meta_context}

The previous analysis established the components below. Most clusters are unchanged and stay where they are; this prompt only shows the slice that changed (new clusters or clusters whose member methods changed).

Existing components (each line shows component_id "name"):
{existing_components}

Cluster groups to assign:
{cfg_clusters}

Think aloud first about whether each cluster belongs to an existing component or warrants a new one, then commit to a routing decision. For each cluster group above, choose exactly one of these two paths:

1. **Route to an existing component.** If the cluster fits naturally into one of the existing components listed above, reference it by its exact component_id (e.g. "1.3"). Reuse that component's name and a short description verbatim, and list the cluster ids you are routing into it. Multiple cluster groups can share the same existing component if they all belong there.

   For each routing decision, consider whether the component's description needs updating. Default to yes — only skip the update when the change is purely cosmetic (a refactor, internal rename, small bug fix, or formatting tweak that leaves the component's high-level purpose untouched). When you skip the update, the existing description is preserved as-is and no follow-up redetail runs. If you're unsure, it's safer to request the update.

2. **Create a new component.** If no existing component is a good fit, create a fresh one. Give it a distinct name that doesn't duplicate any existing component, write a description paragraph explaining what this new component does and why these clusters belong together, and choose a parent component whose scope most naturally encloses the new one (or leave it at root level if nothing fits).

A critical note on identity: components are identified by their component_id, not by name. Reusing an existing component's name without explicitly routing to its component_id will fork a duplicate — that is wrong. If clusters belong in an existing component, you must route to it by component_id.

Every cluster id listed in the "Cluster groups to assign" section must appear in exactly one routing entry."""

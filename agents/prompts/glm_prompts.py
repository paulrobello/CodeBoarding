"""
Prompt templates for Zhipu GLM models.

GLM Prompt Design Principles:
    - Uses heavy directive language ("STRICTLY follow these rules", "MANDATORY", "MUST", "REQUIRED")
      throughout every prompt. GLM models tend to drift from instructions or take creative liberties
      unless constraints are stated emphatically and repeatedly.
    - Each prompt assigns a specific role identity ("You are a software architecture expert",
      "You are a file reference resolver") to anchor the model's behavior. GLM produces more
      consistent output when given a strong persona framing at the start of each prompt.
    - Steps are explicitly labeled with ordering ("REQUIRED STEPS (execute in order)") and output
      sections are marked with "(complete all)" or "(complete ALL)". Without these markers, GLM
      may produce partial outputs or skip required sections.
    - Constraints are stated both positively and negatively ("MUST analyze", "STRICTLY avoid") because
      GLM responds better to explicit boundary-setting than to implied expectations.

INCREMENTAL_GROUPING_MESSAGE = """You are a software architecture analyst. STRICTLY follow these rules.

TASK:
Update the architecture of `{project_name}` by routing changed and new CFG clusters into the correct components.

CONTEXT:
- Project: {project_name}
- Type: {project_type}
- Meta: {meta_context}

The previous analysis established the components below. Most clusters are unchanged and stay where they are; this prompt only shows the slice that changed (new clusters or clusters whose member methods changed).

EXISTING COMPONENTS (each line shows component_id and name):
{existing_components}

CLUSTER GROUPS TO ASSIGN:
{cfg_clusters}

REQUIRED STEPS (execute in order):
1. For each cluster group above, decide whether it belongs in an existing component or warrants a new one.

2. When routing to an existing component, you MUST provide the exact component_id from the list above. Reuse that component's existing name and description verbatim. Multiple cluster groups MAY route to the same component — that is fine. Additionally, set **redetail_needed** to True (the default) whenever the change touches functionality or you are unsure. Set it to False ONLY when the delta is purely cosmetic — a refactor, internal rename, small bug fix, or formatting — AND the component's high-level purpose is clearly unchanged. When False, the existing description is preserved as-is. Bias HEAVILY toward True if uncertain.

3. When creating a new component, leave the existing component reference empty. Provide a fresh name that MUST be distinct from every existing component, a description paragraph explaining what this new component does and WHY these clusters belong together, and the component_id of the parent under which it should attach (or leave empty for root). You MUST choose the parent whose scope most naturally encloses the new component.

CRITICAL RULE:
Identity is by component_id, NOT by name. If clusters belong in an existing component, you MUST reference that component by its exact id — omitting it will fork a duplicate, which is WRONG.

COVERAGE (MANDATORY):
Every cluster id listed in the CLUSTER GROUPS TO ASSIGN section MUST appear in exactly one entry.

Return one routing decision per cluster group. Each decision MUST clearly indicate whether it routes to an existing component (referenced by its exact id from the list above) or proposes a new component with a distinct name, a description paragraph, and the parent it should attach to."""

"""
Prompt templates for OpenAI GPT-4 family models.

GPT-4 Prompt Design Principles:
    - Uses bold markdown headings and structured sections (**Role:**, **Responsibilities:**, **Approach:**)
      because GPT-4 responds well to explicit role definition and clearly labeled instruction blocks.
    - Employs detailed checklists (- [ ] items) for validation tasks. GPT-4 tends to be thorough when
      given an explicit checklist to work through, reducing the chance of skipped criteria.
    - Prompts are more verbose and descriptive than other models require. GPT-4 benefits from explicit
      context and detailed instructions; overly terse prompts can lead to GPT-4 making assumptions or
      filling gaps with generic responses rather than sticking to the task.
    - Expansion and planning prompts include explicit tool lists (readFile, getClassHierarchy, etc.)
      because GPT-4 is less likely to proactively discover and use tools unless explicitly told which
      ones are available and when to use them.

GROUP similar clusters together into logical components based on their relationships and purpose.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the clusters shown above and identify which ones work together or are functionally related
2. Group related clusters into meaningful components
3. A component can contain one or more cluster IDs (e.g., [1], [2, 5], or [3, 7, 9])
4. For each grouped component, provide:
   - **name**: Short, descriptive name for this group (e.g., 'Authentication', 'Data Pipeline', 'Request Handling')
   - **cluster_ids**: List of cluster IDs that belong together (as a list, e.g., [1, 3, 5])

INCREMENTAL_GROUPING_MESSAGE = """**Task:** Update the architecture of {project_name} by routing changed and new CFG clusters into the correct components.

**Context:**
- Project: {project_name}
- Type: {project_type}
- Meta: {meta_context}

The previous analysis established the components below. Most clusters are unchanged and stay where they are; this prompt only shows the slice that changed (new clusters or clusters whose member methods changed).

**Existing components** (each line shows component_id and name):
{existing_components}

**Cluster groups to assign:**
{cfg_clusters}

**Instructions:**

For each cluster group above, decide whether it belongs in an existing component or warrants a brand-new one.

1. **Analyze the clusters** and identify which existing component each one naturally fits into based on functional relationships, shared purpose, and architectural role
2. **Route to an existing component** when the cluster's purpose aligns with something already defined. Reference the existing component by its exact **component_id** (e.g. 1.3), carry forward the current name, and list the cluster ids that now belong there. Multiple cluster groups can route to the same existing component if they share its scope
3. **Flag whether a description refresh is needed.** By default assume **redetail_needed** is True — the cluster change is substantive enough that the component description should be regenerated. Only set it to False when the delta is purely cosmetic: a refactor, internal rename, small bug fix, or formatting change that leaves the component's high-level purpose untouched. When in doubt, keep it True
4. **Create a new component** when no existing one is a good fit. Give it a fresh name distinct from every existing component, write a description paragraph explaining what it does and why these clusters belong together, and specify a **parent_id** pointing to the component whose scope most naturally encloses this new one (or leave it null for a root-level component)

**Important rules:**
- Identity is tracked by **component_id**, not by name. If clusters belong in an existing component, you must reference its **component_id** explicitly — reusing a name without the correct id will fork a duplicate
- Every cluster id listed in the cluster groups above must appear in exactly one routing entry"""

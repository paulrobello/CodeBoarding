    The incremental path requires a populated ``CallGraph._cluster_cache``

    used to silently fall back to a full analysis, which discarded the
    existing analysis.json's depth and component IDs. Callers must
    explicitly opt into a full run instead.

    The constructor inspects ``artifact_dir`` to produce a specific
    diagnostic depending on which piece is missing — pkl absent, sha
    absent (so the warm-start cannot SHA-gate), or pkl present but no
    cluster baseline inside it. Without that distinction, every variant
    of this failure surfaced as "no warm static_analysis.pkl", which
    misled callers when the pkl was actually present.

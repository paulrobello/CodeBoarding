"""Reusable workflow entry points for CodeBoarding analysis.

Public surface:

- :mod:`codeboarding_workflows.analysis` — the three scopes
  (``run_full``, ``run_partial``, ``run_incremental``) plus the shared
  ``run_incremental_workflow`` kernel.
- :mod:`codeboarding_workflows.sources` — local vs. remote repo materialization
- :mod:`codeboarding_workflows.markdown` — docs rendering from ``analysis.json``

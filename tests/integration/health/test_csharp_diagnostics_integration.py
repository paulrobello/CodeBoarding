"""End-to-end test that csharp-ls diagnostics flow through to the unused-code health check.

Why: csharp-ls publishes ``textDocument/publishDiagnostics`` asynchronously
after didOpen, so without the diagnostics-quiesce wait the analyzer's
``collected_diagnostics`` would be empty and the unused-code check would
silently report nothing for C#. This test guards against three regressions
at once:
  1. ``CSharpAdapter.diagnostics_quiesce_seconds`` returns a non-zero window.
  2. ``CSharpAdapter.prepare_project`` runs ``dotnet restore`` so csharp-ls
     can resolve framework references (otherwise it floods CS0518).
  3. CS-prefixed codes (CS8019, CS0162, CS0219, ...) are mapped to dead-code
     categories in ``DIAGNOSTIC_CODE_MAPPINGS``.
